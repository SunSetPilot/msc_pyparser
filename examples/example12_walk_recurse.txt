script: example12_walk_recurse.txt

description:
this program expects one argument: the root configuration file.

Eg. I set up in my webservers an "include" file:
/etc/apache2/modsecurity_includes.conf
/etc/nginx/modsecurity_includes.conf

Both files contains only two lines:

include modsecurity.conf
include /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/owasp-crs.load

I just pass this file to the script, and it loads all included files,
and parses them. Finally, it dumps to an indented JSON file, called
output.json.
